<b>Narrator</b>: Part 1

The heart is considered to be a muscle and, just like any other muscle in your body, your diet has a direct impact on the way that it works. The food you eat  every day can affect the way that blood flows through you heart and arteries . A diet that is high in fat can gradually cause a build-up in your arteries that slows down the blood  flows through your heart and arteries that slows down the blood flow and can even block small arteries. If an artery that carries blood to the heart becomes blocked, the heart muscle can die . This is know as heart attack and sufferers must receive treatment quickly. If the blockage occurs in an artery that carries blood to the brain, part of the brain can die. This is know as a stroke. The effects of a stroke can be debilitatiing and there is no know cure. The correct diet can help you control your weight and keep your arteries clear, thereby reducing the risk of heart problems and stroke.

So, what can you do to lose wieght? Well, exercise is by far the best way. Burning calories and working off the fat will help you look and feel better. Regular exercise helps you burn calories faster, even when you are sitting still. But what  is the best  type of exercise for your heart? Well, studies have shown that aerobic exercise causes you to breathe more deeply and makes your heart work harder to pump blood. Aerobic exercise also raises your heart rate and thus burns calories. Common examples of aerobic exercise include walking briskly, jogging, runing, swmming and cycling.

People are often unsure just how much exercise they need Again, recent studies can help. These have shown that it's best to begin slowly and gradually work up to 30 minutes of exercise, four to six times a week. However, your doctor may make a different recommendation based on your helth. For example, it may be best to start wit only a couple of minutes of exercise or begin at a fairly slow pace. If you are not used to exercise, be sure to pay careful attention to your body. One sure sign that you may be overdoing it is if you can't carry on conversation while you exercise . To give your body the chance to recover, it's also best to alternate exercise days with rest days.
